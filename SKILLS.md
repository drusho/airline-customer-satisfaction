### Technical Skills & Engineering Competencies

This document outlines the key technical skills and engineering competencies demonstrated through the development of the Airline Customer Satisfaction project. It is designed to be a reference for resume building and portfolio writing.

#### **I. Data Engineering Fundamentals**

- **Data Ingestion & Extraction:**
    
    - Proficiently loaded data from flat files (CSV) into a structured format (Pandas DataFrame), a foundational skill for any data pipeline.
        
    - Demonstrated understanding of handling raw data sources and preparing them for analysis.
        
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    
    - **Missing Value Imputation:** Identified and handled null values using a statistically sound method (median imputation for skewed data), ensuring data completeness and integrity.
        
    - **Outlier Detection & Treatment:** Identified outliers using visualization (boxplots) and applied a capping strategy (IQR method) to mitigate their impact on the model.
        
    - **Data Type Conversion:** Ensured all data types were appropriate for analysis and modeling (e.g., converting categorical data to numerical types).
        
- **Data Transformation:**
    
    - **Feature Encoding:** Transformed categorical features into a machine-readable format using one-hot encoding (`get_dummies`), a critical step for preparing data for machine learning algorithms.
        
    - **Binary Encoding:** Converted the target variable into a binary format suitable for logistic regression.
        

#### **II. Programming & Libraries**

- **Python:** Proficient in using Python for data analysis, scripting, and automation.
    
- **Pandas:** Demonstrated extensive use of Pandas for data manipulation, including reading data, inspecting DataFrames (`.info()`, `.describe()`), handling missing values (`.fillna()`), and transforming data (`.map()`, `get_dummies()`).
    
- **NumPy:** Used NumPy for efficient numerical operations, specifically for outlier capping (`np.clip`).
    
- **Data Visualization:**
    
    - **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** Created informative visualizations (boxplots, heatmaps) to explore data distributions and communicate model performance effectively.
        
    - **Missingno:** Utilized specialized libraries to visualize patterns in missing data, aiding in the imputation strategy.
        
- **Scikit-learn:** Applied machine learning techniques for model preparation (`train_test_split`, `RobustScaler`), training (`LogisticRegression`), and evaluation (`accuracy_score`, `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`).
    
- **Statsmodels:** Used `statsmodels` for its detailed statistical summaries to perform rigorous feature selection and interpret model coefficients and p-values.
    

#### **III. Statistical Analysis & Modeling**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics, including distributions, central tendencies, and data quality issues.
    
- **Predictive Modeling:**
    
    - **Logistic Regression:** Successfully implemented and interpreted a logistic regression model to solve a binary classification problem.
        
    - **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
        
- **Feature Engineering & Selection:**
    
    - **Multicollinearity Analysis:** Used Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to diagnose and address multicollinearity among predictor variables, a critical step for building a stable and interpretable model.
        
    - **Backward Stepwise Elimination:** Employed a systematic, data-driven approach to select the most statistically significant features for the final model.
        

#### **IV. Software Engineering Best Practices**

- **Code Modularity:** Demonstrated the ability to structure code into reusable functions (e.g., `plot_box`, `iqr_outliers`, `cap_outliers`), a key principle for writing clean and maintainable code.
    
- **Project Organization:** Structured the project into a logical workflow, separating data exploration/cleaning from modeling in distinct notebooks, which mirrors a professional development environment.
    
- **Documentation:** Used markdown cells to document the analytical process, justify methodological choices, and interpret results, making the work understandable and reproducible for stakeholders and team members.
